# My dotfiles~
### My dotfiles are a hot mess right now (but more and more manageable with every commit)
I made this repo mostly to keep my dotfiles in sync across computers, so yeah...
You can try to grab and use them in their entirety but some things are particular to my computers (display configurations) so it won't work for you.

What I use right now (stuff I have to install on a fresh linux install):
