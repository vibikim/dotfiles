# My dotfiles~
### My dotfiles are a hot mess right now
I made this repo mostly to keep my dotfiles in sync across computers, so yeah...
It's mostly defaults or other's configs slightly modified to my taste.

What I use right now (stuff I have to install on a fresh linux install):

* bspwm
* sxhkd
* polybar
* dunst
* kitty   (will do st in the future)
* pcmanfm and lf
* rofi AND dmenu (weird i know)
* vim
* copyq
* flameshot
* picom/compton
* xfce4-power-manager
* nm-applet
* lxqt-policykit
* firefox
* rhythmbox -- TODO migrate to a MPD based music player
* lxapperance (optional)
* NerdFonts
* **DASH set as /bin/sh** (Arch Linux)
