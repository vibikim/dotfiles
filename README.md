# My dotfiles~
###My dotfiles are a hot mess right now
I made this repo mostly to keep my dotfiles in sync across computers, so yeah...
It's mostly defaults or other's configs slightly modified to my taste.

What I use right now (stuff I have to install on a fresh linux install):
_Some are normie programs, please don't judge_
*awesomewm
*kitty   (but I also have a termite config in there)
*vim
*copyq
*flameshot
*picom/compton
*xfce4-power-manager
*nm-applet
*firefox
*rhythmbox
*lxde-apperance (optional)
*NerdFonts
